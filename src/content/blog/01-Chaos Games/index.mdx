## Introduction
Last week, after having written my first blog post, I got interested in creating a more general framework which supports more general [Iterated Function Systems (IFSs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system).

In general, an IFS can described as a finite set of [contractive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping)
$$
f_j: X \to X,
$$
where $X$ is a compact metric space, and the associated fractal $S$ for a generating subset $S_0$ is obtained iteratively through:
$$
\begin{align*}
S_{i+1} &= \bigcup_{j}  f_j(S_i),\\
S &= \limsup_{i \to \infty} S_i.
\end{align*}
$$
This is 
My implementation is available on my [Github](https://github.com/SrPolipo), on the [manim-projects](https://github.com/SrPolipo/manim-projects/tree/main/chaosgame) repository.
Here are some project examples:

A visualization of iterations of the Barnsley Fern, linearly interpolated with a linear rate function:
