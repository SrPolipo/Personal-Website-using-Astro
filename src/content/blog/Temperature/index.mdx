While I was on the metro, on my way back home from an Ergodic Theory exam, I started wondering about how I'd go about predicting
tomorrow's average temperature from known temperature data. 

This lead me to the following postulates about a model, based on my empiric experience:

* The sequence of average temperatures should be a discrete-time stochastic process $(\tau_i)_i$, taking real values;
* Today's temperature is heavily corrolated with yesterday's weather, and also the days before, but negligeably corrolated after long enough time.
* The corrolation between $\tau_i$ and $\tau_{i+k}$ should only depend on $k$.

This lead me into the following type of model:
$$
\tau_i = \sum_{k=1}^r c_{k} \tau_{i-k} + \epsilon_i
$$
Where the $c_k$ are constants and the $\epsilon_i$ are noise.
Using standard techniques in dealing with convolutions we can linearize this equation, taking $k=3$ to simplify visualization this gives:
$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \tau_{i-2}\\ \tau_{i-1}\\ \tau_i\end{bmatrix}}_{T_{i+1}}= 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
0&1&0\\
0&0&1\\
c_3&c_2&c_1
\end{bmatrix}}_C
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \tau_{i-3}\\ \tau_{i-2}\\ \tau_{i-1}\end{bmatrix}}_{T_{i}} + \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\\epsilon_i \end{bmatrix}}_{E_i} 
$$
Or in a more compact way, which is true for all $k$:
$$
T_{i+1} = CT_i + E_i
$$
At this point, solving for $C$ gave me:
$$
C = T_{i+1}T_i^{-1} - E_iT_i^{-1}
$$
from which it became apparent that, since $T_i$ can have very small eigenvalues, that estimation of $C$ through averages is probably not a good idea.
Hence I had to completely scratch this idea for estimation.

After reformulating the problem in terms of the noise:
$$
T_{i+1} - CT_i = E_i
$$
It becomes apparent, that we should choose $C$ such that it minimizes some norm on $E_i$, geometrically this would be the Frobenius norm.
Hence, I was able to rediscover L
