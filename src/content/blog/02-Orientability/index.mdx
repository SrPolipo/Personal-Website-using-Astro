## Intuitive description of orientability

In geometry, the notion of [orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability) is an intrinsic property for [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold).
Informally, manifolds are geometric objects which when zoomed in look flat. Some typical examples of manifolds include circles, spheres, [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) as well as [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime).

In particular, for surfaces, the notion of orientability is rather intuitive:
<center>
A surface is said to be orientable if there exists a continuous notion of "upward" for every point on the surface.
</center>

## The Möbius strip
The Möbius strip is a mathematical object, which can be obtained from gluing two ends of a strip of paper after applying a twist.
As can be seen via [this photo by David Benbennick](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=142071794):

In particular, for our definition of orientable surface it becomes rather intuitive to show that the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) is not orientable.
Since, if it was orientable, the initial arrow would agree with the final arrow on the following animation:

## Final remarks

The general the notion of orientability is much different, and intimately connected to the notion of [integrability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form).
However, it is also interesting to point out that this definition of orientability can also be generalized to manifolds of [codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension) one.
