## Background
[Carlos Reinaldo](https://www.youtube.com/@carlos_reinaldo) is a Spanish math communicator with over a million views across his social media accounts. 
I've known him for almost 7 years, and we were classmates during our Bachelor's degree.

In his newest YouTube video, he introduces **Fourier Series** in a way that is very understandable and perfectly geared towards a general audience.

### Heart Animation
In particular, it features a well-edited version of this animation I made:

<video 
  width="640" 
  height="360" 
  controls 
  preload="auto">
  <source src="/videos/heart.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Full Video
The full video, which I definitely recommend, is available below:
