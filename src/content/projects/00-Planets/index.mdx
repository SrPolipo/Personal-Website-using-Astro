## Visualizing the Solar system
An interesting fact about the Solar system is that since the orbits of the planets are nearly coplanar, we can draw a faithful picture of the relative angles of the planets to the sun on a
two-dimensional plane.

This surprising fact is what inspired me to create the following visualization of the Solar system, which is updated every time this page is loaded:


<Planets></Planets>

While the size of the planets is merely for illustration and is not to scale, the distance of the planets to the sun is accurate on a logarithmic scale and the angles between
the planets and the sun correspond exactly to the angles of the night sky.

### About the code
Since this project is open-source, the relevant code for this visualization is available [here](https://github.com/SrPolipo/Personal-Website-using-Astro/blob/main/src/components/Planets.astro).
